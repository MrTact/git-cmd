# Contributing

Hey thanks for reading this! It means you're curious about git-cmd or want to help
make it better! Here are a couple of ways you can help.

## Triaging

There's so many things to add or fix on top of the normal day to day that it's
easy to let things slip through the cracks. Helping prioritize, update tickets,
or tagging them is a huge help!

## Documentation

Examples, code, and docs for the api always could use help getting documented.
This will always be the case. Any and all help is appreciated. Can you translate
the existing documentation to another language? Did you spot a mistake that needs
to get fixed up? Send a PR in! Docs are vital to any project and is an easy way
to make a big splash.

## Code

Know Rust and want to fix bugs or add new features? Awesome! Send in a PR! In
the case of adding a new feature please open up a relevant ticket to track
progress if there is no ticket for the git subcommand.

Every subcommand addition needs the following:

- Tests
- API Documentation
- The actual changes
- Checking it off the list in the README file

### Commit standard
Any commits sent to the project via PR should follow these guidelines. Changes
will not be merged until they are in this format:

## Conclusion

The fact you want to help out even in a small way by spending your free time on
this project does not go unnoticed. Thank you!
